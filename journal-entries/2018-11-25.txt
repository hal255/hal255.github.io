2018-11-25: Game Jam, and researched some business strategies

Topic:Game Jam

From Nov 15 to today, I was working on a game jam (https://github.com/michellelynne/LTC_game_jam).
The game is similar to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Q6gjULhds
Our hosted game: https://e-a-n.github.io/pathLight-staging/

My contributions had been in the following states: boot, load, and gameloop (scrolling map).
I find I have a tendency to get too far ahead of others when I am "in the zone" and it can cause some issues.
Some contributions were not fruitful, such as the testing suite using unit.js library. It was not in the direction we needed.
Being relatively new to game development, my implementation were not in best practices, such as not having data driven architecure.
I learned alot from this project, such as shifting from object oriented programming to data oriented programming.
More importantly, I gained insights on the workflow of working on a game from people who work in Jam City (mobile developing studio).


Topic:Business Strategies

After reviewing which game engine to move forward with, I decided to go with Unity. I also plan on purchasing the Unity plus in FY2019 and experience the 25GB storage.
I wanted to push for Godot and not pay any fees, but it wasn't "Python enough" for my taste, felt more of Javascript.
For that reason alone, I felt Godot's API documentation was not as extensive as Unity. Perhaps, I'll revisit this another time.

As for which platform to host the games, my choice of platforms are: itch.io, apple, android, gog, steam, and myself (maybe).
I like itch.io for it's indie friendly business model so that will most likely be a priority.
Hosting it myself is also an option that I have to build upon when I release enough games.
Apple and Android, I plan to release low budget games first, thus it would only make more sense to release it as mobile.
GOG and Steam.... maybe.
